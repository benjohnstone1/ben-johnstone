                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>I’ve worked extensively with Salesforce, integrating 3rd party solutions in order to continue to scale and grow our operations and see full value in our business intelligence solutions. A large focus has been in spearheading the implementation of Zuora, a CPQ and billing solution, which used in conjunction with Salesforce
                    to generate quotes and then on the back end to facilitate and manage billing operations and provide better data for SaaS metrics.
                </p>

                <p>Post implementation, we've begun to see the real value in implementing these solutions and I'm now focusing efforts on our Series C fund raise.</p>
                <h4>Notable Achievements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Administered demonstration of the Salesforce quoting flow lifecycle to outside and inside sales team at global sales kickoff to be used as Q&A and gather further requirements prior to Zuora implementation to be able to tailor the solution to best fit their needs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implemented Adobe Sign e-signature into quoting flow in Salesforce which gave increased visibility to sales managers and also resulted in decreased time taken to receive signed order forms by over 50% by providing a painless more efficient process
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        New billing solution allowed us to scale our billing operations exponentially. Our small team was maxed out with handling 500 clients in 2 currencies. We managed to scale to over 1000 clients in 6 different currencies with no additional headcount in the
                        billing and collections department with capacity for more
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Took part in weekly pipeline calls which was invaluable to understanding how the team was positioning our products to the client and seeing where we could provide value add. I then worked with the outside sales reps on a 1-1 basis in order to personalize
                        their dashboards and give better reporting into their pipeline, this helped the team focus their efforts where it was most needed and spending less time on deals that were unlikely to close
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The metrics we’ve gathered from our data allowed us to identify areas of product improvement, for example, we had products that only triggered upon usage, when adding a recurring element we found that we managed to increase our communications revenue
                        by over 16% per sale and customers were more likely to adopt the product
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Managed multiple stakeholders across different business units (Sales, Finance, Client Success, Marketing & Design) in order to get buy-in to CPQ solution and aid in delivery of solution 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>I joined IBM as a Technical Consultant within IBM's Global Business Services division based in London, UK. This role required 100% travel and as a graduate entry program, I had the opportunity to experience a breadth of consulting roles,
                    including within project management, development, and both pre and post sales consulting.
                </p>
                <h4>Notable Achievements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Completed 5 week consulting workshop where we received training on presentation skills and working in a client-facing environment. This was a hugely beneficial course where we focussed on presentation style and being able to communicate and present technical
                        solutions to a non-technical audience
                    </li>
                    <li>I was project manager for a team that created a mobile solution using IBM Worklight which I then demoed to an IBM executive panel. The demo was a pre-sales consulting training scenario in which we were responding to an RFP put forward
                        in the Australian public sector.</li>
                    <li>Voted 2nd amongst my peers as training champion</li>
